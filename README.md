# Microservices

Just a bunch of really dumb "Hello, World" style APIs that have been Dockerized and share a common `docker-compose.yml`

# Usage (why would you use this?)
1. `git clone <this repo>`
2. `cd microservices`
3. `docker-compose up`
4. visit the URLs

# URLs (like anyone's ever going to use this):
1. [Golang](http://localhost:8001)
2. [Java](http://localhost:8002)
3. [Python](http://localhost:8003)
4. [.NET](http://localhost:8004)
5. [Node.JS](http://localhost:8005)
