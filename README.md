# Microservices

Just a bunch of really dumb "Hello, World" style APIs that have been Dockerized and share a common `docker-compose.yml`

# Usage (why would you use this?)
1. `git clone <this repo>`
2. `cd microservices`
3. `docker-compose up`
4. visit the URLs

# URLs (like anyone's ever going to use this):
1. [http://localhost:8001](Golang)
2. [http://localhost:8002](Java)
3. [http://localhost:8003](Python)
4. [http://localhost:8004](.NET)
5. [http://localhost:8005](Node.JS)
